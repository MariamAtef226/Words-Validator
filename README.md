# Words-Validator
Based on a loaded text file for a dictionary, the C program checks if an entered set of words is spelled correctly or not. 
If not, a set of suggestions is given to the user to indicate alternatives.
It was the final project for data structures 1 course. I've done it individually. The algorithm is mainly based on Trees data structure.
