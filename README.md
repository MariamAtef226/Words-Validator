# Words-Validator :a:

### Project Description :page_facing_up:
Based on a loaded text file for a dictionary, the C program checks if an entered set of words is spelled correctly or not. If not, a set of suggestions is given to the user to indicate alternatives. It was a final project for data structures 1 course. The algorithm is mainly based on Trees data structure.

### Pre-requisites ❔
- Windows operating system to run main.exe (but project.c is executable on any system).
- GNU (or any othe C compiler) to compile project.c.
- You should have the EN-US-Dictionary.txt file downloaded in the same direction as the app's file so that it runs

### How to use the application :question:
- Run the .exe file
- Enter the sentence you'd like to check its words
- If a word is spelled correctly, the application tells you so. Else, it suggests some similar words that you might have meant to type instead.
- The app keeps running until you press "Ctrl + z"
